							<p class="hello">
								Yelp is a crowd sourced local business review and social networking site, where users post their reviews about a business using a star rating system on a scale of one to five.
							</p> 

								<p class="hello">
								 Our research is based on two things; firstly trying to understand the factors that affect the ratings that a business gets and secondly, since Yelp is a social network in itself, we try to understand how a user who has reviewed a business is influenced by his ego network and if that too could be one of the reasons why a person would prefer going to a restaurant. Often businesses like restaurants take paper based feedback from the customers that visit them. We use the online reviews from Yelp and train a model on it, through which we predict if a user would review or give feedback for a business based on the users friend opinions. 
								</p>

								<section id="features">
								<p class="hello">
								<b>This study is one of the first ones to explore the social network in a website like Yelp. In our research, we define a term Ego Influence as the combination of the following factors: </b>
									<ul class="hello">
									 <li><u> Social Influence:  </u></li>
									 	<p>This feature is a measure of to what extent a user's action/behavior of visting a business (restaurant) is influenced by his/her social network. If most the user's friends visit a joint then would the user also visit that place ?</p>
									 <li><u> Social Sentiment  </u></li>
									 	<p>This feature goes a step beyond the first one. It takes into account the opinions of a user's online friend circle and predicts whether the user would visit a place depending on what the user's friend have to say about that place. The opinion could be a positive one or a negative one depending on their reviews. </p>
									 <li><u> Closeness with friends in network  </u></li>
									 	<p>This feature gives us another important way to measure whether a user would visit a place depending on how close is she with her network. We define the <i><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/pagerank.shtml">Personalized Page Rank</a></i> value of a user to be the closeness of user to her network. </p>
									</ul>

									   			1. Given an ego nodes sentiment score (for a business), his personalized page rank (Closeness) and social influence measure, can we predict if a user has given review or not.
									   		</i>
								   		</p></br>
								   	</section>

									   			2. What factors influence a persons visit to a restaurant ?

								   	</section>
							   	</p>

								<p class="hello"><b>We derived some significant results from our study: </b></p>
								<p>
									<ul class="hello">
										<li>Our regression model suggests that Closeness with your friends (Personalized Page Rank) is a very strong factor that helps predicting the ratings that a business receives. </li>
										<li>Besides closeness; Price, Average User review count and number of fans that a user has also form good predictors. </li>
										<li>Our classifier gives 68% accuracy for predicting whether a user will review a restaurant or not depending on influence of his friends.</li>
									</ul>
